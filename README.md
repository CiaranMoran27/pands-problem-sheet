## Introduction
This README file gives a more in-depth explanation of the code used to complete the weekly tasks for the 2021<br/>Programming and Scripting GMIT module as part of the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing.  
<br/>


## Task 1: (Bmi.py):
*Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). The inputs are the person's height in centimetres<br/>and weight in kilograms. The output is their weight divided by their height in metres squared.* 
<br/>

### Code:
``` Python
height = float(input("What is your height in centimetres?:"))
weight = float(input("What is your weight kilograms?:"))
metres_sq = (height/100)**2
bmi = round(weight / metres_sq,2)
print("BMI is " + str(bmi) + ' kg/m²')
```

### Code breakdown:
- User is asked for their height(cm) and weight(Kg).
- Height is convered from cm to m² and stored in *metres_sq* variable.
- Weight(Kg) is divided by height(m²), rounded to two decimal places and passed to *bmi* variable.
- The bmi result is passed into a {} placeholder via string formatting and printed.

## Task 2: (secondstring.py):

*Write a program that takes asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order.*
<br/>

### Code:
``` Python
sentence = input("Please enter a sentence: ")
reverse_string = sentence[::-2]
print(reverse_string)
```

### Code breakdown:
- User is asked to input a sentence.
- The full string is sliced by default as no index number is placed in the first two placeholders of [::-2].
- A negative stride of 2 is used and the the resulting string stored in the reverse_string variable.
- The reversed string is printed.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

## Task 3: (collatz.py):

*Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following:*<br/>
 *At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and:*
    - *Divide by 2 if even.*
    - *Multily by 3 and add 1 if odd.*
    - *End the progam if current value is 1.*

<br/>

### Code:
``` Python
numberList = []

number = input("Enter a positive integer: ")

while True:
    try:
        numberInt = int(number)

        if numberInt < 0: 
            numberInt = int(input("Enter a Enter a positive number: "))
            continue            
        else:
            break                  

    except ValueError:                          
        number = input("Enter an integer: ")    
        continue                              

while numberInt!=1:              
    if numberInt % 2 == 0:             
        numberInt = numberInt // 2     
    else:
        numberInt = (numberInt * 3) + 1  
    numberList.append(numberInt)       
print(numberList)
```

### Code breakdown:
- User is asked for a positive integer.
- **First While loop** is designed to validate the user input in the block of code between  *try* and *except* where:
    - Tries to convert the input string to an integer, if this fails a *ValueError* is raised and the program asks the <br/> user to *"Enter an integer: "* and jumps back to the start of the while loop.
    - Assuming that point 1 above has executed sucessfully (i.e the user input can be cast as an integer) the program <br/>checks if the integer is negative, in which case  the program asks user to *"Enter a Enter a positive number: "* and jumps <br/> back to the start of the while loop.
 - **Second While loop** performs sucessive calculations on user input and resulting values until the resulting value=1. 
     - Checks if the remainder of the user input divided by 2 = 0 (i.e is it even), in which case the program re-defines <br/>the *numberInt* variable as itself divide by 2 and appends it to *numberList*.
     - Checks if the remainder of the user input divided by 2 != 0 (i.e is it odd), in which case the program re-defines <br/>the *numberInt* variable as (itself divided by 3) + 1 and appends it to *numberList*.
         - The while loop runs re-uses the newly defined *numberInt* variable until the value = 1, then the list is <br/>printed.

## Task 4: (weekday.py):

*Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.*
<br/>

### Code:
``` Python
import datetime

weekIndex = {
0 : "Weekday",
1 : "Weekday",
2 : "Weekday",
3 : "Weekday",
4 : "Weekday",
5 : "Weekend",
6 : "Weekend"
    }

todaysDate = datetime.date.today()    
dayIndex = todaysDate.weekday()

for key, value in weekIndex.items():  
    if key == dayIndex:                 
        if value == "Weekend":              
            print("It is the {}, yay!".format(value))
        else:
            print("Yes, unfortunately today is a {}.".format(value)) 
```

### Code breakdown:
- The datetime module is imported
- Dictionary named weekIndex is declared:
    - Keys are set to 0-6 which represent the index of the days of the week (i.e index 0 = Monday, index 6 = Sunday).
    - Values distunguish between weekdays or weekend.
    - The *todaysDate* variable uses the *.date.today* methods of  datetime library to obtain todays date.
    - The *dayIndex* variable uses the *.weekday* method of  datetime library to convert todays date to an index <br/>number(0 - 6).
- The key, value pairs of dictionary *weekIndex* are iterated over until the key = *dayIndex* value.
    - When the above condition is met, the corresponding value of the key is checked in a boolean (to see if it reads <br/>"Weekend" or "Weekday") and one of two print statements are executed.

## Task 5: (squareroot.py):

*Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.*
<br/>

### Code:
``` Python

def userValidation():
    while True:
        number = input("Please enter a positive number: ")
        try:

            numberFloat = float(number)  
            if numberFloat < 0:          
                continue                           
            else:
                sqrt(numberFloat)           
                break   

        except ValueError:           
            continue            


def sqrt(numberFloat,tolerance = 0.000001):         
    estimate = numberFloat                          
    diff = 9999999999                              

    while diff > tolerance:                         
        newEstimate = estimate - ((estimate**2 - numberFloat) / (2*estimate))   
        estimate = newEstimate     
        diff = newEstimate - estimate                  
        diff = abs(diff)                               
                            
    print("The square root of {} is approx. {}".format(numberFloat,round(newEstimate,2))) 

userValidation() 
```

### Code breakdown:
- User is asked for a positive integer.
- **User Validation function** is designed to validate the user input in the block of code between  *try* and *except* where:
    - Tries to convert the input string to a float, if this fails a *ValueError* is raised and the program asks the <br/> user to enter a positive numberand jumps back to the start of the while loop.
    - Assuming that point 1 above has executed sucessfully (i.e the user input can be cast as a float) the program <br/>checks if the float is negative, in which case  the program asks user to enter a positive number and jumps <br/> back to the <br/>start of the while loop.
    - Condintinal that the user input meets the preceeding criteria, the input is passed into the *sqrt* function.
 - **Square Root Function** uses Newton's method for approximating square root which works by producing successively <br/>better approximations:
     - The function recieves the user input *numberFloat* which is re-defined as *estimate*.
     - The function parameter *tolerance* is set to a low number. Assigning a low number is important as it will play <br/>a part in determining when the proceeding while loop will break.
     - A variable called *diff* is set to a large number to ensure the first iteration of the while loop will run <br/>(i.e *while diff > tolerance*).
     - The *newEstimate* variable is dervied by passing the userinput into Newtons Equation,  and then refining itself <br/>to *estimate* (for further use on next while loop iteration).
     - If the difference between the *newEstimate* and *estimate* (i.e user input on first iteration) is greater than <br/>the tolerance limit set, the while loop restarts, however when its less the output is printed.

## Task 6: (es.py):

*This program reads in a text file that is requested by user and outputs the number of "e" characters in the file.*
<br/>

### Code:
``` Python

import os

os.chdir(os.path.dirname(__file__))     

def userInput():
    choice = input("Enter text file name for uppercase/lowercase 'e' character count: ").strip()
    return choice


def readFile(choice):
    while True:
        try:

            with open(choice,'r') as f:           
                data = (f.read())                   
                return data

        except IOError:                        
            print("This file does not exist")
            choice =userInput()                   
            continue                              

def eCharacterCount(data):
    e_List = []
    E_List = [] 

    for line in data:
        for character in line:
            if character == 'e':
                e_List.append(character)
            elif character == 'E':
                E_List.append(character)

    print("There are {} lowercase 'e' characters in this text file".format(len(e_List)))
    print("There are {} uppercase 'E' characters in this text file".format(len(E_List)))


choice = userInput()                             
data = readFile(choice)
eCharacterCount(data)
 

```
